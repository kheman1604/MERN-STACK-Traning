1. Lecture1.js(JSG.js , JSG2.js) ==> Introduction to Arrow Functions in JavaScrip and arrow functions with one statement .

2. Lecture2.js(lect-2.js) ==> Passing and Returning Functions as and Argument 
               ==> Spread Operator to have argument in the form of a Array . 

3. Lecture3.js(lect-3.js) ==> Let and var variable declarations.
                   ==> A variable declared with var has its scope throughout the program whereas if its 
                       declared with let its scope is limited within the block itself .
                   
                   ==> Example : let a=10; // It has a scope limited to  the block in which this variable is declared.
                                var a=10; // This variable can be accesssed even outside its block .
                   
                   ==> toFixed() Method : The toFixed() method converts a number into a string, rounding to a specified number of decimals.
                                          If the desired number of decimals are higher than the actual number, zeros are added to create the desired decimal length.
                   ==> Setting a Interval in JavaScript . SetTimeout in JS .
                   ==> Date And Time Function in JavaScrip . 
                   ==>Concept for Array of Fnctions . How can we call all the functions in an array at once using for each loop .
                   ==> if we pass lesser number of arguments while calling a function the rest to the arguments are regarded as undefined.
